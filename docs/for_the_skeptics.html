      <h1>For the Skeptics</h1>
      <p>This page addresses common points of skepticism regarding the FIRM framework. Our goal is to provide clear, evidence-based responses and to openly acknowledge the current limitations and future work required.</p>
      
      <section id="coincidence">
        <h2>Argument 1: The Coincidence Claim</h2>
        <p><strong>The Skeptical View:</strong> "The repeated appearance of the golden ratio (φ) in your calculations is just numerology or cherry-picking. You're finding patterns where none exist."</p>
        <p><strong>Our Response:</strong> This is a valid and crucial concern. The φ-based patterns in FIRM are not assumptions; they are derived consequences of the foundational axioms. The golden ratio emerges as the unique spectral radius of the Grace Operator, which acts as a universal stabilizer on recursive mathematical structures. It is not "put in" to the theory, but rather "falls out" of the axiomatic framework. The scientific claim of FIRM is that this derived φ-scaling is the underlying cause of the physical constants we observe.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="falsifiability">
        <h2>Argument 2: Falsifiability</h2>
        <p><strong>The Skeptical View:</strong> "A real scientific theory must be falsifiable. What specific, high-risk predictions does your theory make that, if proven wrong, would invalidate it?"</p>
        <p><strong>Our Response:</strong> FIRM is acutely falsifiable. The theory predicts the values of fundamental constants to a high degree of precision from first principles. For example, it predicts the fine-structure constant, α, to be exactly 1/137.0359991. If future, more precise measurements of α deviate from this value beyond the predicted error bars, the theory in its current form is invalidated. A list of high-risk, falsifiable predictions is maintained in the repository.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="parameters">
        <h2>Argument 3: The "Zero Free Parameters" Claim</h2>
        <p><strong>The Skeptical View:</strong> "The claim of 'zero free parameters' is misleading. Every theory has assumptions and choices that are equivalent to free parameters."</p>
        <p><strong>Our Response:</strong> The "zero free parameters" claim refers to the absence of adjustable numerical constants in the theory's equations. While FIRM is built on a set of foundational axioms, these axioms are formal, structural rules, not tunable numerical values. The theory's predictive power comes from the mathematical consequences of these axioms alone. This is in contrast to theories that contain numerical constants that must be determined by experiment.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="peer-review">
        <h2>Argument 4: Lack of Peer Review</h2>
        <p><strong>The Skeptical View:</strong> "This work hasn't been peer-reviewed or accepted by the mainstream physics community. It's fringe science."</p>
        <p><strong>Our Response:</strong> We acknowledge that FIRM is in the early stages of development and has not yet undergone formal peer review. The purpose of this public repository is to invite scrutiny and collaboration from the scientific community. We are committed to a transparent process and are actively preparing a manuscript for submission to a peer-reviewed journal. The complete code and derivation chains are available for independent verification.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="standard-model">
        <h2>Argument 5: Relationship to the Standard Model</h2>
        <p><strong>The Skeptical View:</strong> "How does this framework relate to the Standard Model of Particle Physics, which is the most successful theory in the history of science?"</p>
        <p><strong>Our Response:</strong> FIRM is not intended to replace the Standard Model, but to provide a deeper theoretical foundation for it. The goal is to derive the parameters of the Standard Model (such as particle masses and coupling constants) from first principles, rather than measuring them experimentally. If successful, FIRM would provide a "why" for the "what" of the Standard Model, potentially unifying it with gravity and cosmology in a single, coherent mathematical framework.</p>
