      <h2>Explain It Like I'm 25</h2>
      <p>Imagine you're building with LEGOs, but instead of a manual, you have a single, powerful rule. That rule is "φ" (phi, the golden ratio).</p>
      <p><strong>The Core Idea:</strong> This project, FIRM, proposes that the fundamental "rules" of the universe (the physical constants, like the speed of light or the charge of an electron) aren't random. They are the most stable, most perfect structures that can emerge from this single "φ" rule. It's like finding the most stable LEGO castle you can build—it has a specific, mathematically determined shape.</p>
      <p><strong>What We Do:</strong> We don't guess or try to fit the numbers. We start with pure mathematics (our "φ" rule) and build, step-by-step, to derive the values of these constants. The fact that our derived values are incredibly close to what scientists measure in the real world suggests our "φ" rule is on the right track.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> If we're right, it means the universe has a deep, underlying mathematical elegance. We could potentially understand *why* the universe is the way it is, not just *what* it is. It's a shift from describing the universe to truly understanding its blueprint.</p>

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <div class="skeptical-view"><strong>The Skeptical View:</strong> "The repeated appearance of the golden ratio (φ) in your calculations is just numerology or cherry-picking. You're finding patterns where none exist, a practice common in fringe science."</div>
            <div class="response"><strong>Our Response:</strong> This is a valid and crucial concern that separates rigorous science from pseudoscience. The distinction lies in the origin of the patterns. Numerology starts with data and searches for mathematical patterns after the fact. FIRM's approach starts with a set of formal axioms that do not contain φ. From these axioms, we derive a universal stabilizing operator. The golden ratio, φ, emerges as the inevitable mathematical consequence of this operator's recursive application.<br><br>In other words, φ is not an input we select; it is an output of the system's fundamental structure. It is not a pattern we sought in the data, but a prediction generated by the axiomatic framework, which we then test against data.</div>

          <button class="accordion-header">Is it falsifiable?</button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <div class="skeptical-view"><strong>The Skeptical View:</strong> "A real scientific theory must be falsifiable. What specific, high-risk predictions does your theory make that, if proven wrong, would invalidate it?"</div>
            <div class="response"><strong>Our Response:</strong> FIRM is acutely and deliberately falsifiable. Unlike theories with tunable parameters that can be adjusted to fit new data, FIRM makes exact, rigid predictions. If any of these core predictions are shown to be incorrect by more precise future experiments, the theory in its current form is invalidated. This is a feature, not a bug.<br><br>Here are three examples of high-risk, falsifiable predictions:
              <ol>
                <li><strong>The Fine-Structure Constant (α):</strong> FIRM predicts α⁻¹ to be 137.035999157... This value is derived from the geometry of the dimensional bridge and the spectral values of the Grace Operator. The current experimental value (CODATA 2018) is 137.035999084(21). A future measurement that confirms a value outside our derived number's error margin would be a critical failure.</li>
                <li><strong>The Electron-Proton Mass Ratio:</strong> The theory predicts a value for mₚ/mₑ based on the φ-scaling of particle stability shells. This prediction is currently being refined but will provide another precise, falsifiable benchmark.</li>
                <li><strong>The Cosmological Constant (Λ):</strong> FIRM derives the value of Λ from the baseline energy level of the φ-field. This results in a predicted dark energy density of Ω_Λ ≈ 0.685, which is exceptionally close to the observed value but derived entirely from theory. Any significant change in the measured value would challenge the framework.</li>

          <button class="accordion-header">Argument 3: The "Zero Free Parameters" Claim</button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <div class="skeptical-view"><strong>The Skeptical View:</strong> "The claim of 'zero free parameters' is misleading. Every theory has foundational assumptions, and your axioms are equivalent to free parameters."</div>
            <div class="response"><strong>Our Response:</strong> This point deserves careful clarification. When we say "zero free parameters," we are referring to the absence of *adjustable numerical constants* that are fine-tuned to match experimental data. The Standard Model, for example, contains approximately 19 such parameters (e.g., the mass of the electron, the strength of the electroweak force) whose values are determined by measurement and fed into the theory.<br><br>FIRM has foundational axioms, which are structural and logical rules about how mathematical objects can exist and interact. These are not numbers to be tuned. Once the axioms are set, the entire system unfolds without any further numerical input. The theory's strength—and its vulnerability—lies in the fact that we cannot adjust it if a prediction is slightly off. The entire axiomatic structure would have to be re-evaluated, which is a much more profound change than tuning a parameter.</div>

            <div class="skeptical-view"><strong>The Skeptical View:</strong> "This work hasn't been peer-reviewed or accepted by the mainstream physics community. This is just a website, not a scientific publication."</div>
            <div class="response"><strong>Our Response:</strong> We fully agree that formal peer review is a cornerstone of scientific validation. FIRM is a work in progress, and we have chosen a path of radical transparency by developing it in public. This repository represents an open, continuous form of peer review, where every line of code, every derivation, and every result is available for scrutiny by anyone at any time.<br><br>Our roadmap includes:
              <ul>
                  <li>Active preparation of a manuscript for submission to a top-tier, peer-reviewed physics journal.</li>
                  <li>Engaging with experts in both physics and mathematics for pre-submission feedback.</li>
                  <li>Providing a fully reproducible computational environment, allowing any researcher to verify our results from scratch—a standard of transparency that exceeds that of most traditional publications.</li>
              </ul>
              We believe this open process is the most effective way to build a robust and verifiable theory.

            <div class="skeptical-view"><strong>The Skeptical View:</strong> "How does this framework relate to the Standard Model of Particle Physics, which is the most successful and experimentally verified theory in the history of science?"</div>
            <div class="response"><strong>Our Response:</strong> FIRM does not aim to *replace* the Standard Model. Rather, it seeks to *explain* it. The Standard Model is a powerful descriptive framework (a "what"), but it does not explain *why* its ~19 free parameters have the specific values they do (the "why"). FIRM is a candidate "pre-Standard Model" theory. It proposes a deeper layer of reality from which the Standard Model's structure and parameters emerge.</div>

            <div class="response"><strong>Our Response:</strong> While FIRM certainly has philosophical implications, it is grounded in testable, physical predictions. The claim is not that the universe "is" φ, but that the physical laws we observe are a consequence of a self-consistent mathematical structure in which φ plays a crucial stabilizing role. The theory stands or falls on its ability to predict experimental results.</div>
