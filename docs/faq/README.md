Editorial policy

- Evidence separation: Answers about experiment vs theory must keep the firewall boundary explicit.
- No tuning: Avoid language implying “we adjusted to match X.” All derivations proceed from axioms to results; divergence is documented, not tuned.
- Reproducibility: Link to specific modules/tests; provide exact commands when helpful.
