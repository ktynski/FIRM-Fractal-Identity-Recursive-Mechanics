Templates checklist

- Integrity headers: Include a scientific integrity section with firewall and provenance notes in each template.
- Reproducibility: Provide sections for commands and environment details (Python version, `PYTHONPATH`, seeds).
- Claims separation: Distinguish conceptual illustrations vs empirical validation outputs.
