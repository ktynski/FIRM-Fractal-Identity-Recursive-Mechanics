## Demos

Audience: general public. Clearly labeled as demonstrations; not validation or evidence. No upstream effect on theory.

---

Principles

- Separation: Demos illustrate concepts and visuals; they do not test or validate the theory.
- Gating: Any overlay of experimental metadata must call into the validation firewall; never embed numbers into demo code or narrative.
- Clarity: Label figures as “theory-only illustration” unless explicitly produced under validation mode.
