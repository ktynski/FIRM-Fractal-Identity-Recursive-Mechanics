Volitional Field Theory: Complete FIRM Volitional Framework

This package implements the complete volitional field formalization for FIRM theory,
including volitional structures across œÜ-recursive phases and physical constant derivations.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Volitional Field ||ùí±‚Çô|| across œÜ-recursive phases œÜ‚Å∞ to œÜ‚Åπ‚Å∞
    - Category-theoretic formalization of volitional structures
    - Physical constant derivations from first morphic principles
    - Soul coherence functor and morphic scaling relationships
    - Grace-initiated monad and volitional charge dynamics

Key Modules:
    - complete_framework.py: Complete volitional field framework

Volitional Phases:
    - œÜ‚Å∞: Ex nihilo emergence
    - œÜ‚Å∑: Electromagnetic phase
    - œÜ¬≥¬π: Quantum gravity
    - œÜ‚Åπ‚Å∞: Cosmological scale

Core Insights:
    - "Volition is not a force. It is a recursive attractor. A soul-vector in morphic space."
    - "The Volitional Field ||ùí±‚Çô|| encodes the alignment energy required for
      soul-instantiation, action, or conscious coherence at recursion level œÜ‚Åø"
