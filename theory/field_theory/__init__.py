Field Theory: Complete FIRM Field Theory Framework

This package implements the complete field theory framework for FIRM,
including Lagrangian formulations, field equations, and quantum field theory.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Derives from: foundation/operators (Grace Operator, œÜ-recursion)
    - Depends on: Mathematical foundation only
    - Enables: Complete physical field theory predictions

Key Modules:
    - lagrangian.py: Complete Lagrangian framework and action principles
    - field_equations.py: Unified field equations (Euler-Lagrange derivations)
    - morphic_equations.py: Morphic field equation specifics
    - qft_integration.py: Quantum field theory integration
    - advanced/: Advanced field theory topics

Field Theory Pipeline:
    Mathematical axioms ‚Üí Grace Operator ‚Üí Field equations ‚Üí Physical predictions

Provenance:
    - All results trace to: foundation/axioms (Aùí¢.1-4, AŒ®.1)
    - No empirical inputs: Pure theoretical field theory
    - Complete derivations: Lagrangian ‚Üí Euler-Lagrange ‚Üí Physical equations

Scientific Integrity:
    - Zero free parameters: All field structure from œÜ-mathematics
    - Complete provenance: Field equations from foundational axioms
    - No empirical fitting: Pure theoretical construction
    - Academic verification: Full mathematical field theory audit
