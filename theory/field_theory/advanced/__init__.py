Advanced Field Theory: Specialized FIRM Field Theory Topics

This package contains advanced and specialized field theory implementations
that extend beyond the core Lagrangian and field equation framework.

Advanced Topics:
    - phase_lensing.py: Phase lensing theory and gravitational effects
    - [Future advanced topics as needed]

Scientific Integrity:
    - All advanced theories derive from core field theory framework
    - No empirical inputs: Pure theoretical extensions
    - Complete provenance: Advanced theories trace to foundational axioms
