Mathematics: Advanced Mathematical Frameworks for FIRM Theory

This package implements advanced mathematical frameworks that bridge the pure
mathematical foundation with physical theory applications.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Derives from: foundation/ (axioms, operators, categories)
    - Bridges to: theory/physics and theory/field_theory
    - Provides: Advanced mathematical tools for physical applications

Key Modules:
    - advanced_framework.py: Advanced mathematical frameworks and tools

Mathematical Tools:
    - Extended algebraic structures
    - Advanced analysis techniques
    - Specialized mathematical methods for FIRM applications
    - Mathematical bridge constructions
