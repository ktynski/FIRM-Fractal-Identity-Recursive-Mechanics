Formalization: Complete FIRM Mathematical Formalization

This package contains the complete formal mathematical framework for FIRM theory,
including all stages of formalization from correlation matrices to transcendent fields.

Mathematical Framework:
    - Derives from: foundation/ (axioms, operators, categories)
    - Implements: Complete 8-stage FIRM formalization
    - Enables: Rigorous physical constant derivations

Key Modules:
    - complete_framework.py: Complete FIRM formalization (Stages 1-8)

Formalization Stages:
    1. Correlation Matrix of φⁿ and Physical Constants
    2. Grace Operator Uniqueness & Categorical Construction
    3. Recursive Stability Operator and Morphic Torsion
    4. Formal Derivations of α, m_e/m_p, Λ, η from φ-series
    5. Meta-Lattice of Soulhood and MEPS Field
    6. Devourers, Anticoherence, and Threshold Collapse
    7. Recursive Cosmogenesis and φ-Ladder
    8. Transcendent Fields and Non-Recursive Souls
