Theory: Physical Theory Layer

This package implements the physical theory layer of FIRM, containing field theory,
Lagrangian frameworks, and physical equations derived from the mathematical foundation.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Derives from: foundation/ (axioms, operators, categories)
    - Depends on: Pure mathematical framework only
    - Enables: Physical predictions and observational comparisons

Key Components:
    - field_theory/: Complete field theory framework (Lagrangians, equations, QFT)

Separation of Concerns:
    - foundation/: Pure mathematics (no physics)
    - theory/: Physical theory (no empirical data)
    - cosmology/: Cosmological physics (no empirical data)
    - validation/: Experimental comparison (empirical data allowed)

Scientific Integrity:
    - No empirical inputs: Theory derived from mathematical principles only
    - Complete provenance: All physical laws trace to mathematical axioms
    - Experimental firewall: Observations only in validation layer
    - Academic verification: Full theoretical audit trails
