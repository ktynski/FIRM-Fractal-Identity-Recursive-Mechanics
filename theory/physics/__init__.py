Physics: FIRM Physical Theory Implementation

This package implements the complete physical theory layer derived from FIRM's
mathematical foundation, containing rigorous physics engines and modules.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Derives from: theory/field_theory (Lagrangians, field equations)
    - Depends on: foundation/ (pure mathematical framework)
    - Enables: Physical predictions with complete provenance tracking

Key Modules:
    - rigorous_physics_engine.py: Complete physics engine with scientific integrity
    - advanced_modules.py: Advanced physics modules and frameworks

Scientific Integrity:
    - Complete provenance tracing for all physical derivations
    - Zero empirical contamination: Theory derives from mathematics only
    - Falsifiability testing framework built-in
    - Anti-tuning safeguards and null hypothesis testing
