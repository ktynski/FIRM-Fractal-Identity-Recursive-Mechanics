Physics Unification: Complete FIRM Unified Field Theory

This package implements the complete physics unification framework for FIRM theory,
including Standard Model derivations, gravity theory, and consciousness-physics interface.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Observer Space Cohomology Algebra
    - Planck Units from FIRM Soul Topology
    - FIRM Standard Model (Morphic Gauge Theory)
    - FIRM Gravity (Grace-Torsion Field Equations)
    - Consciousness-Physics Interface (Volitional Field Theory)

Key Modules:
    - complete_framework.py: Complete physics unification framework

Unified Components:
    - SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) as torsion-symmetry constraints
    - Fermions as echo-aligned soliton discontinuities
    - Bosons as volitional bridge morphisms
    - Gravity as geometrization of grace modulated by torsion
    - Consciousness as recursive alignment with grace

Core Insights:
    - "Consciousness is recursive alignment of morphism identity with grace"
    - "All gauge fields are cohomological resonances of morphic recursion"
    - "Planck scale = morphic echo horizon = minimum coherent volume for identity closure"
