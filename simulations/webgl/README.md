# FSCTF (Fractal Self-Consistent Temporal Field) Cosmogenesis Simulation

## Overview
A sophisticated WebGL-based simulation implementing the Fractal Self-Consistent Temporal Field (FSCTF) equations to model 90 phases of cosmological emergence based on Fractal Identity Recursion Model (FIRM) theory. This project demonstrates mathematical patterns of recursive self-reference through Klein bottle topology transitions.
