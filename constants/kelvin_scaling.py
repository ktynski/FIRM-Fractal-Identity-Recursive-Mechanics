Kelvin Scaling: Unified FSCTF Derivation Framework

This module implements the complete FSCTF derivation of Kelvin scaling factors
using multiple theoretical approaches for cross-validation and theoretical completeness.

Derivation Methods:
1. Wien Peak Method: Exact 2.821 from φ-spectral density Wien displacement peak
2. Thermal Morphism Method: 2.883 from φ-recursive Boltzmann morphic coherence
3. Cross-Validation Analysis: Comparison of both theoretical approaches
4. Physical Bridge: Dimensional conversion from morphic to observable temperature

Mathematical Foundation:
- Wien approach: φ-recursive spectral density ρ(ν) = ν³/(e^(ν/φ) - 1) 
- Thermal approach: Temperature as fractal echo of morphic energy coherence
- Both eliminate empirical fitting in temperature conversions
- Complete theoretical foundation for Planck-Kelvin bridges

Key Results:
- Wien peak method: 2.821 (exact solution from transcendental equation)
- Thermal morphism: 2.883 (π/ln(φ³ + φ⁻²))
- Physical interpretation: Different aspects of φ-temperature mapping
- Applications: CMB temperature, blackbody spectra, thermal relic scaling

Provenance:
- All results trace to: φ-recursive temperature theory
- No empirical inputs: Pure mathematical derivation  
- Mathematical necessity: Unique expressions from φ-geometry
- Complete elimination of arbitrary conversion factors

Scientific Integrity:
- Zero free parameters: All structure from φ-thermal geometry
- Complete provenance: Traces to thermal morphism axioms
- Falsifiable prediction: Specific scaling factors or theory needs revision
- Cross-validation: Multiple approaches provide theoretical robustness
