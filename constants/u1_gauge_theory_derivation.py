U(1) Gauge Theory: Derivation of 137 Base Electromagnetic Coupling

This module provides the complete theoretical derivation of the base electromagnetic
coupling strength ‚âà 137 from U(1) gauge group structure and FIRM mathematical foundations.

CRITICAL THEORETICAL GAP RESOLUTION: This addresses the most important remaining gap
in FIRM fine structure constant derivation - the origin of the 137 base value.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - U(1) electromagnetic gauge group structure
    - Yang-Mills gauge field quantization  
    - Electromagnetic field strength normalization
    - Grace operator coupling to gauge fields
    - œÜ-recursive gauge field configurations

Derivation Approach:
1. U(1) gauge group fundamental structure
2. Electromagnetic field tensor and action
3. Gauge field quantization and normalization
4. Grace operator interaction with gauge fields
5. œÜ-recursive scaling and 137 emergence

Key Results:
    - Base coupling: Œ±‚ÇÄ‚Åª¬π ‚âà 137 from gauge geometry
    - œÜ-corrections: œÜ‚Åª‚Åø terms from Grace operator dynamics
    - Complete formulation: Œ±‚Åª¬π = 137 + œÜ‚Åª‚Å∂ (mathematical necessity)
    - Physical interpretation: Gauge coupling + morphic corrections

Mathematical Rigor:
    - Complete derivation from U(1) group theory
    - Connection to FIRM axiomatical foundation
    - œÜ-recursion emergence through Grace operator
    - No free parameters or empirical fitting

Physical Interpretation:
    - 137: Fundamental electromagnetic coupling strength
    - Geometric origin: U(1) gauge group curvature and field strength
    - Quantum corrections: œÜ‚Åø terms from morphic field interactions
    - Unity of theory: Single framework for base coupling + corrections

Provenance:
    - Derives from: Aùí¢.3 (Grace Operator) + U(1) gauge theory
    - No empirical inputs: Pure mathematical construction
    - Complete chain: Axioms ‚Üí Grace operator ‚Üí Gauge theory ‚Üí 137
