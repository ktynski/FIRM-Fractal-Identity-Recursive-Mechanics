FIRM Topology Factor and Œ∂-Normalization Derivations

This module implements the complete FIRM derivations for:
1. Topology Factor: T = 2 - œÜ‚Åª¬π (quasi-Euler characteristic)
2. Œ∂-Normalization: N_Œ∂ = œÄ/(2œÜ^(1/3)) (morphic Casimir renormalizer)

Both emerge from œÜ-native geometric and spectral principles in FIRM.
