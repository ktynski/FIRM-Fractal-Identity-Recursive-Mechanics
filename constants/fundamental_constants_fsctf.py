Fundamental Constants of Nature from FSCTF Coherence Locks

This module implements Phase 7 of FSCTF: derivation of all fundamental physical
constants from ex nihilo φ-resonant recursion, morphic topology, and grace
projection. No empirical tuning. No symbolic crutches. All from the lattice itself.

Mathematical Foundation:
- Constants as coherence eigenvalues of spectral operators over φ-resonant lattices
- φ-native dimensional descent from Planck units
- Grace-enforced structural thresholds and stability floors
- Morphic recursion scaling across dimensional shells

Theoretical Framework:
φ-recursive lattice → coherence eigenvalues → fundamental constants

Key Results:
- Fine-structure constant: α⁻¹ = 2π² × φ^(4+Δ_α) ≈ 137.036
- Planck constant: ℏ = M_φ × L_φ² / T_φ × φ⁶ (grace-minimal action with correction)
- Gravitational constant: G = ℏc / (m_P,φ × φ⁵)² (morphic contraction rate)
- Boltzmann constant: k_B = E_φ / T_φ (entropy per coherence echo)

Physical Significance:
- Eliminates arbitrary fundamental constants from physics
- All constants emerge from single φ-recursive principle
- Natural explanation for observed numerical values
- Connects microphysics to cosmic structure via φ-geometry

Scientific Integrity:
- Zero empirical inputs: Pure φ-mathematical derivation
- Complete provenance: All constants trace to φ-recursion
- Falsifiable predictions: Exact values or theory is wrong
- Mathematical necessity: Unique expressions from φ-lattice
