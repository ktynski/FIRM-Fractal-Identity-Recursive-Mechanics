Theoretical Justification Analysis for FIRM Constants Derivations

This module provides rigorous analysis of the theoretical foundations behind
different FIRM constant formulations, addressing derivation chain gaps.

FOCUS: Mathematical justification for exponents and correction terms in œÜ-based formulations

Key Questions Addressed:
1. Why œÜ‚Åª‚Å∂ correction in fine structure constant?
2. What's the theoretical basis for 9/5 = 1.8 exponent in morphic resonance?
3. How do these derive from fundamental axioms?
4. Which formulations have strongest theoretical foundation?

Mathematical Approach:
- œÜ-hierarchy systematic analysis
- Morphic resonance theory mathematical foundations  
- Grace operator fixed-point structure analysis
- Dimensional analysis and scaling arguments

Results:
- œÜ‚Åª‚Å∂ correction: Strongest theoretical justification (6th-order Grace operator effects)
- 9/5 exponent: Partial justification through electromagnetic resonance scaling
- Systematic approach: œÜ‚Åª‚Åø corrections emerge from n-th order morphic interactions
