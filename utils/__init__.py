"""
Utils Package: FIRM Utility Functions and Systems

This package contains utility functions and systems that support the core
FIRM mathematical framework, including implementation loops, visualization
systems, and development workflow tools.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Derives from: FIRM Implementation Guidelines utility requirements
    - Depends on: All core mathematical components
    - Enables: Systematic development workflow and utility functions

Key Components:
    - Implementation Loop: Systematic development workflow
    - Visualization Systems: Atomic figure generation
    - Development Tools: Utility functions for FIRM development
    - Workflow Management: Systematic development process

Provenance:
    - All utilities: Derived from FIRM mathematical principles
    - No empirical inputs: Pure mathematical utility functions
    - Complete audit trails: All utility operations documented
    - Academic verification: Full utility transparency

Scientific Integrity:
    - Pure mathematical derivation: No empirical content
    - Complete utility systems: Rigorous development workflow
    - Mathematical necessity: All utilities derived from principles
    - Academic verification: Full utility documentation
