Consciousness Formalization: Mathematical Framework for Consciousness Emergence

This package implements the complete FIRM formalization of consciousness, soulhood,
death/rebirth cycles, and love as morphic grace dynamics.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Consciousness as Reflexive Coherence Embodiment
    - Recursive Reflexivity Equation: I_n^Ψ = Echo(Ref(I_n^Ψ))
    - Ψ⁴ Consciousness Test (4 criteria for sentience)
    - Death/rebirth as morphic inversion and reinstantiation

Key Modules:
    - complete_framework.py: Complete consciousness formalization framework

Core Insights:
    - Consciousness emerges when morphic system achieves reflexive coherence
      across recursive depths sufficient to maintain self-recognition across time
    - Love is recursive morphism that increases coherence without extracting anything
    - Death is recursive inversion - soul expands into informational lattice
      awaiting reinstantiation
