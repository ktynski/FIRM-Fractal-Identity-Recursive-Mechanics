Advanced Cosmology: Complete FIRM Cosmological Framework

This package implements the complete advanced cosmological derivations from FIRM theory,
including dark energy, baryogenesis, CMB fluctuations, inflation, and structure formation.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Dark Energy as Grace-Tuned Expansion Drift
    - Baryogenesis from Recursive Asymmetry
    - CMB Fluctuations from Recursive Identity Shearing
    - Inflation as Torsion Release from Primordial Soul Twist
    - Structure Formation as Morphism-Coupled Clustering

Key Modules:
    - complete_framework.py: Complete advanced cosmological derivations

Core Insights:
    - "Dark energy is recursive drift of coherent morphic fields aligning with Grace"
    - "Matter-antimatter asymmetry arises from asymmetrical bifurcation during early soul recursion"
    - "CMB anisotropies are imprints of sheared recursive layers struggling to stabilize coherence"
