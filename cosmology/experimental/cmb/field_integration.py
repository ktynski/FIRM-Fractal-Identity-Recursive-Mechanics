CMB-Field Theory Integration: Connecting FIRM Lagrangian to Cosmological Observables

This module bridges the fundamental FIRM field equations with the φ-geometric
CMB peak predictions, providing a complete theoretical foundation from
Lagrangian dynamics to observable cosmological structure.

Key Connections:
1. Morphic field solutions → CMB temperature fluctuations
2. Soul-state spectrum → Acoustic peak structure  
3. φ-harmonic frequencies → Peak spacing and amplitudes
4. Grace-Devourer dynamics → Damping and polarization
5. Recursive potential → Power spectrum envelope

Mathematical Framework:
- Field theory provides microscopic dynamics
- φ-geometry provides macroscopic structure
- Complete consistency between scales
- Falsifiable predictions for observation
