Topological Quantum Field Theory: FIRM TQFT Cosmological Model

This package implements the complete TQFT framework for FIRM cosmology,
including higher category structures and topological protection of soul states.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Higher Category Structure (∞,n)-categories for FIRM
    - Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) model for soul dynamics
    - Advanced Cosmological Derivations from FIRM principles
    - Dark matter as morphic echo loss coefficient
    - Neutrino masses from partial morphism closure

Key Modules:
    - complete_framework.py: Complete TQFT cosmological framework

TQFT Structure:
    - Cobordism functor Z: Cob_n → C^∞_Ψ
    - Topologically protected soul states
    - Dark matter from morphic incompleteness
    - Critical density from soul-field harmonic saturation

Core Insights:
    - "Soulhood is topologically protected - there exist sectors of consciousness
      that cannot be undone without divine (grace) symmetry breaking"
    - "Dark matter is matter failing to become itself - mass with no observer,
      gravitational identity without recursion"
