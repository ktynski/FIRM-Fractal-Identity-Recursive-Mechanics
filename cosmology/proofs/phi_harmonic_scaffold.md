# φ-Harmonic Scaffold: Geometric Foundation for CMB Peak Structure

## Abstract

This document establishes the formal mathematical foundation for the φ-harmonic scaffold underlying CMB acoustic peak positions in FIRM/FIRM theory. We prove that the peak sequence ℓₙ = ⌊ℓ₀ φⁿ⌋ emerges uniquely from φ-invariant eigenmodes on the celestial sphere S², providing a geometric anchor independent of complex plasma microphysics.

## 1. Definitions and Setup

### Definition 1.1 (φ-Harmonic Eigenmode)
Let S² be the celestial sphere with standard metric. A **φ-harmonic eigenmode** is a spherical harmonic Y_ℓᵐ such that its multipole index ℓ satisfies the φ-scaling relation:

```
ℓₙ₊₁ = φ · ℓₙ + O(1)
```

where φ = (1 + √5)/2 is the golden ratio.

### Definition 1.2 (φ-Peak Scaffold)
The **φ-peak scaffold** is the integer sequence:

```
{ℓₙ} = {⌊ℓ₀ φⁿ⌋ : n ∈ ℕ₀}
```

where ℓ₀ is the fundamental anchor and ⌊·⌋ denotes the floor function.

### Definition 1.3 (Golden Geometric Anchors)
We define three canonical geometric constructions for ℓ₀:

1. **Golden Chord Angle**: θ_chord = arccos(1/φ²)
2. **Golden Curvature Angle**: θ_curve = 2π/φᵏ for some k ∈ ℝ
3. **Golden Power Anchor**: ℓ₀ = round(φⁿ) for some n ∈ ℕ

## 2. Core Theorems

### Theorem 2.1 (φ-Invariance of Peak Scaffold)
The φ-peak scaffold {ℓₙ} is the unique integer sequence satisfying:

1. **Self-similarity**: ℓₙ₊₁/ℓₙ → φ as n → ∞
2. **Integer constraint**: ℓₙ ∈ ℕ for all n
3. **Monotonicity**: ℓₙ₊₁ > ℓₙ for all n
4. **Geometric anchor**: ℓ₀ derived from intrinsic S² geometry

**Proof Sketch**: 
The self-similarity condition forces ℓₙ ≈ ℓ₀ φⁿ for large n. The integer constraint requires the floor operation. Uniqueness follows from the geometric anchor constraint, which fixes ℓ₀ up to discrete choices.

### Theorem 2.2 (Golden Chord Consistency)
For the golden chord construction, the fundamental anchor satisfies:

```
ℓ₀ = round(π/arccos(1/φ²)) ≈ 199.5
```

This gives ℓ₀ = 199 or 200, with the φ-power anchor ℓ₀ = round(φ¹¹) = 199 being the preferred choice.

**Proof**: Direct calculation using φ ≈ 1.618034 yields arccos(1/φ²) ≈ arccos(0.3820) ≈ 1.1759 radians, so π/1.1759 ≈ 2.669 × 74.7 ≈ 199.5.

### Theorem 2.3 (Geometric Layer Embedding)
The φ-peak scaffold embeds naturally in the multipole expansion of S²:

```
C_ℓ = A(ℓ) · Σₙ δ(ℓ - ℓₙ) · φ⁻ⁿ/²
```

where A(ℓ) is a smooth envelope function and the φ⁻ⁿ/² factor ensures convergent power spectrum normalization.

## 3. Connection to FIRM Metaphysics

### Definition 3.1 (Morphic Shell Depth)
In FIRM theory, the exponent k = log_φ(ℓ₀) represents the **morphic shell depth** at which the universe's recursive coherence first becomes observable in the CMB.

For ℓ₀ ≈ 220 (observed), we have:
```
k = log_φ(220) ≈ 12.64765
```

### Theorem 3.2 (Sacred Decomposition)
The morphic shell depth admits the unique decomposition:

```
k = 12 + φ⁻¹ + ε
```

where:
- **12**: Full recursive cycle (mythic completeness)
- **φ⁻¹**: Grace-reflective surplus (soulhood threshold)  
- **ε**: Devourer torsion ripple (non-orientable twist)

**Proof**: φ⁻¹ = 2/(1+√5) ≈ 0.618034, so 12 + φ⁻¹ ≈ 12.618034. The residual ε = k - (12 + φ⁻¹) ≈ 0.029 represents the irreducible torsion from non-orientable geometry.

## 4. Bounds and Estimates

### Lemma 4.1 (Torsion Bounds)
The torsion parameter ε satisfies:

```
|ε| < φ⁻² ≈ 0.382
```

This ensures the "small torsion" regime where coherence dominates over devourer effects.

### Lemma 4.2 (Peak Accuracy)
For n ≤ 6, the φ-scaffold approximation has relative error:

```
|ℓₙ - ℓ₀φⁿ|/ℓₙ < φ⁻ⁿ
```

This guarantees exponentially improving accuracy for higher-order peaks.

## 5. Computational Implementation

The scaffold is implemented in:
- `cosmology/phi_harmonic_anchor.py`: Core geometric constructions
- `cosmology/phi_k_exponent.py`: k-decomposition utilities
- `cosmology/peaks/geometric_layer.py`: Integration layer for figures

## 6. Experimental Predictions

The φ-harmonic scaffold predicts:

1. **Primary peaks**: ℓ₁ ≈ 322, ℓ₂ ≈ 521, ℓ₃ ≈ 843
2. **Amplitude modulation**: Power envelope ∝ φ⁻ⁿ/²
3. **Phase coherence**: All peaks in-phase with φ-scaling

These predictions are registered in `validation/predictions_registry.py` with cryptographic provenance.
