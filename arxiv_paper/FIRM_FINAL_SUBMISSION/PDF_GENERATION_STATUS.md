# PDF Generation Status Report

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS: PDF GENERATED

- New build completed successfully via `compile.sh` after fixing script I/O decoding and running full sequence.
- Output: `main.pdf` (size ~5.42 MB, 169 pages)
- Location: `arxiv_paper/FIRM_FINAL_SUBMISSION/main.pdf`

## 🔍 NOTES FROM LOG

- Info/warnings remain (hyperref tokens in PDF strings, some over/underfull hboxes, duplicate appendix anchors). These do not block PDF generation.
- Some math/list structure warnings in `sections/consciousness_eeg_harmonics.tex` and `derivations_appendix.tex` were recovered by TeX; content renders.

## 📄 HOW IT WAS BUILT

```bash
cd arxiv_paper/FIRM_FINAL_SUBMISSION
python3 generate_pdf.py
bash compile.sh
```

## 📌 NEXT CLEANUPS (NON-BLOCKING)

- Sanitize math in section headings to avoid hyperref warnings.
- Review list environments containing inline math to reduce “Missing $ inserted” recoveries.
- De-duplicate appendix anchors or rename sections to remove duplicate destination warnings.

## ✅ ARTIFACTS UPDATED

- `main.pdf` regenerated and present.
- `main.log` and `main.aux` updated for this build.
