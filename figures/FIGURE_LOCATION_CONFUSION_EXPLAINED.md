# 🤔 FIGURE LOCATION CONFUSION EXPLAINED

## ❓ **User Question**: "What are the figures outside that folder then? I'm confused"

**You're absolutely right to be confused!** The figures are scattered across **multiple directories** due to historical development and different organizational attempts.

## 📁 **WHERE THE FIGURES ARE LOCATED:**

### **Primary Location (What we just generated):**
- ✅ **`figures/outputs/`** - 20+ PNG files (our main working directory)

### **Historical Locations (Pre-existing):**
- 📁 **`figures/`** (top level) - ~8 files directly in the main directory
- 📁 **`figures/consolidated_outputs/`** - ~20+ files (previous consolidation attempt)  
- 📁 **`arxiv_paper/FIRM_FINAL_SUBMISSION/figures/`** - ~27 files (paper submission copies)
- 📁 **`docs/assets/`** - ~10 files (documentation copies)
- 📁 **`arxiv_paper/FIRM_FINAL_SUBMISSION_arxiv_tmp/figures/`** - More copies
- 📁 **`arxiv_paper/FIRM_FINAL_SUBMISSION/figures_for_paper/`** - Even more copies

## 🔍 **THE PROBLEM:**

### **Multiple Duplicates Everywhere**:
The same figure (like `grace_operator_fixed_point_convergence.png`) exists in:
1. `figures/outputs/grace_operator_fixed_point_convergence.png`
2. `figures/grace_operator_fixed_point_convergence.png`
3. `figures/consolidated_outputs/grace_operator_fixed_point_convergence.png`
4. `arxiv_paper/FIRM_FINAL_SUBMISSION/figures/grace_operator_fixed_point_convergence.png`
5. `docs/assets/grace_operator_fixed_point_convergence.png`
6. And more...

### **Historical Reasons**:
- **Original development**: Figures saved directly in `figures/`
- **Consolidation attempt**: Created `figures/consolidated_outputs/`
- **Paper preparation**: Copied to `arxiv_paper/.../figures/`
- **Documentation**: Copied to `docs/assets/`
- **Our current work**: Using `figures/outputs/`

## 📊 **CURRENT SITUATION:**

### **What We Actually Generated Today:**
- ✅ **10 fresh figures** in `figures/outputs/` (verified by timestamps)
- ✅ **Master generator working** and outputting to `figures/outputs/`
- ✅ **20 total figures** accessible in the main outputs directory

### **What's Confusing:**
- ❓ **60+ duplicate PNG files** scattered across 6+ directories
- ❓ **Different versions** may exist in different locations
- ❓ **No clear "single source of truth"** for which figures are current

## 🎯 **SIMPLE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION:**

### **The figures outside `figures/outputs/` are:**
1. **Historical duplicates** from previous development phases
2. **Paper submission copies** for ArXiv
3. **Documentation copies** for README files
4. **Consolidation attempts** that created more copies
5. **Development artifacts** from iterative work

### **Which Directory Should You Use?**
✅ **`figures/outputs/`** - This is our current, verified working directory with 20 confirmed figures

## 🧹 **CLEANUP RECOMMENDATION:**

The project would benefit from:
1. **Single source of truth**: Keep only `figures/outputs/`
2. **Remove duplicates** from other directories
3. **Symbolic links** for paper/docs that point to `outputs/`
4. **Clear organization** instead of scattered copies

## 💡 **BOTTOM LINE:**

**You have 20+ working figures in `figures/outputs/`** - everything else is historical clutter and duplicates that accumulated during development.

**The confusion is completely justified** - this is a messy file organization that should be cleaned up!
