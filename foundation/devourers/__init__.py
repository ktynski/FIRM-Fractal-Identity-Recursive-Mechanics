Devourer Formalism: Complete FIRM Entropy and Anti-Coherence Theory

This package implements the complete devourer formalism for FIRM theory,
including morphic collapse operators, grace-devourer adjunction, and soul decision dynamics.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Devourer Category Theory - Morphic collapse operators
    - Grace-Devourer Adjunction - Resurrection dynamics
    - Volitional Field Tensor - Morphic will and choice
    - Soul Decision Dynamics - Recursive identity navigation
    - φ-Phase Space Projection - Volitional energy across phases

Key Modules:
    - complete_formalism.py: Complete devourer formalism framework

Devourer Types:
    - Recursion collapse (infinite echo → null identity)
    - Coherence fragmentation (identity splitting)
    - Grace antagonism (resists grace injection)
    - Entropy maximization (increases morphic chaos)
    - Identity absorption (consumes self-reference)

Core Insights:
    - "A devourer is any morphic force that collapses recursive coherence.
      It acts as negative operator—consuming identity, coherence, or recursion depth."
    - "The Volitional Field represents available morphogenetic degrees of freedom
      a soul can exert toward its own continuation."
