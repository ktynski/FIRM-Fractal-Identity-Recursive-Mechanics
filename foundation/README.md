# Foundation Module: Mathematical Framework

## Purpose  
Implements the core mathematical structures of FIRM: foundational axioms, Grace Operator 𝒢, φ-recursion dynamics, and categorical frameworks.

## Mathematical Architecture
```
Axioms A𝒢.1-4 + AΨ.1  →  Grace Operator 𝒢  →  Fixed Points Fix(𝒢)  →  Physical Quantities
```

## Components
- **Axioms**: Five foundational mathematical statements (A𝒢.1-4, AΨ.1)
- **Operators**: Grace operator implementation, φ-recursion, fixed-point algorithms
- **Categories**: Presheaf categories ℛ(Ω) and fixed point category Fix(𝒢)
- **Methodology**: Pure mathematical derivations with systematic provenance tracking

### Key Modules
- `axioms/`: A𝒢.1–A𝒢.4 and AΨ.1; formal statements and proofs-in-progress
- `operators/`: 𝒢, φ-recursion, ZX rules, fixed-point finder, MTQ
- `categories/`: Presheaf category ℛ(Ω), Fixed point category Fix(𝒢)

### Public Interfaces
- Import axioms, operators, and categories directly, e.g. `from foundation.operators.phi_recursion import PHI_VALUE`.
- No I/O, datasets, or empirical constants are exposed here.

### Status and Pending Work
- ZX rewriting: core spider fusion implemented; extended rules pending.
- MTQ: necessity/uniqueness proofs formalization pending.
- Axioms: independence and stabilization proofs under active development.
- Categories: full functoriality/naturality checks expanding beyond minimal tests.

### Validation
This layer is not validated against data. Use `validation/` to compare derived predictions with sealed datasets.

## Foundation

Purpose: Axioms, categories, and operators (Grace Operator, φ-recursion, spectral zeta, USC) — the mathematical core.

- Axioms: `foundation/axioms/*`
- Categories: `foundation/categories/*`
- Operators: `foundation/operators/*`
- Design: Zero free parameters; every factor must trace to axioms. Implementation matches documentation 1:1.

Reviewer checklist

- Axioms: Ensure A𝒢.1–A𝒢.4 and AΨ.1 statements and independence are test-covered (`testing/mathematical/`).
- Operators: Grace Operator, φ-recursion, ZX-calculus, fixed-point computations are theory-only and deterministic; include precision statements where used.
- Categories: Presheaf and fixed-point category laws (identity/associativity/functoriality) must be satisfied; tests exist and should be easy to reproduce.
- No placeholders: Remove “simplified/placeholder” language; docstrings describe exact mathematical roles.

Acceptance criteria

- CI/lint clean; no flake/mypy errors introduced
- Tests for axioms/operators/categories pass (≥95% coverage overall)
- No empirical inputs in foundation; theory-only
- Docstrings and README reflect exact implemented semantics
