Foundation: Pure Mathematical Framework

This package implements the complete mathematical foundation of FIRM theory,
deriving all physical reality from five foundational axioms with zero empirical input.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Derives from: Pure mathematical logic and set theory
    - Depends on: No external physical input
    - Enables: All physical constant and structure derivations

Key Results:
    - Grace Operator ùí¢ existence and uniqueness
    - œÜ = (1+‚àö5)/2 emergence from pure recursion
    - Fixed point category Fix(ùí¢) defining physical reality
    - Complete Russell's paradox resolution

Provenance:
    - All results trace to: Aùí¢.1-4, AŒ®.1 foundational axioms
    - No empirical inputs: Verified by contamination detection
    - Error bounds: Mathematical convergence proofs with explicit bounds

References:
    - FIRM Perfect Architecture, Part I: Mathematical Foundations
    - Category Theory and Topos Theory foundations
    - Banach Fixed Point Theorem applications

Scientific Integrity:
    - Complete provenance tracking enabled
    - Cryptographic sealing of all derivations
    - Automated contamination detection active
    - Peer review audit trail generation
