A𝒢.2: Reflexive Internalization (Self-Reference Without Paradox)

This module implements the second foundational axiom enabling paradox-free
self-reference through the Yoneda embedding in category theory.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Derives from: A𝒢.1 (Stratified Totality)
    - Depends on: Grothendieck universe hierarchy Ω
    - Enables: A𝒢.3 (Grace Operator), self-referential mathematical structures

Mathematical Statement:
    There exists a reflexive internalization ℛ(Ω) := PSh(Ω) = [Ω^op, Set]
    with Yoneda embedding e: Ω ↪ ℛ(Ω) such that e(X) = Hom_Ω(-, X)
    enables self-reference without Russell's paradox.

Key Results:
    - Yoneda embedding enables safe self-reference
    - Presheaf category ℛ(Ω) contains all mathematical structures
    - Full faithfulness: Isomorphisms preserved under embedding
    - Foundation for Grace Operator domain and codomain

Provenance:
    - All results trace to: A𝒢.1 totality + Yoneda lemma
    - No empirical inputs: Pure category theory construction
    - Error bounds: Logical consistency (no numerical approximation)

Physical Significance:
    - Enables observer to be part of observed system
    - Resolves quantum measurement paradox
    - Foundation for consciousness integration
    - Self-referential physical laws become possible

Mathematical Properties:
    - Full faithfulness: e preserves all categorical structure
    - Dense embedding: Every presheaf is colimit of representables
    - Topos structure: ℛ(Ω) has complete logical structure
    - Self-containment: ℛ(Ω) can represent its own structure

Scientific Integrity:

    - Yoneda lemma application: Rigorous category theory
    - Self-reference resolution: Paradox-free by construction
    - Mathematical completeness: Full embedding preservation
