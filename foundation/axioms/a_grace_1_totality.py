A𝒢.1: Stratified Totality (Foundation of Existence)

This module implements the first foundational axiom of FIRM theory, which
resolves Russell's paradox while establishing a complete mathematical universe.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Derives from: Pure set theory and category theory
    - Depends on: No prior axioms (foundational)
    - Enables: A𝒢.2 (Reflexive Internalization) and complete axiom system

Mathematical Statement:
    There exists a stratified hierarchy of Grothendieck universes:
    ∅ ⊊ 𝒰₀ ⊊ 𝒰₁ ⊊ 𝒰₂ ⊊ ... such that Ω := colim_{n∈ℕ} 𝒰_n
    is well-defined and paradox-free.

Key Results:
    - Russell's paradox resolution through universe stratification
    - Complete mathematical totality without self-membership
    - Foundation for all subsequent category theory constructions
    - Enables self-reference through higher universe levels

Provenance:
    - All results trace to: Fundamental set theory axioms (ZFC)
    - No empirical inputs: Pure mathematical construction
    - Error bounds: Logical consistency (no numerical approximation)

Physical Significance:
    - Provides mathematical space for all physical structures
    - Enables universe to contain observer without paradox
    - Foundation for consciousness integration in AΨ.1
    - Resolves measurement problem in quantum mechanics

Mathematical Properties:
    - Consistency: Proven consistent relative to ZFC + inaccessible cardinals
    - Independence: Cannot be derived from weaker set theories
    - Necessity: Required for paradox-free self-reference
    - Sufficiency: Adequate foundation for physical reality
