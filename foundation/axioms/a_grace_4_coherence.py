A𝒢.4: Fixed Point Coherence (Physical Reality Selection)

This module implements the fourth foundational axiom establishing coherence
of Grace Operator fixed points as the category of physical reality.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Derives from: A𝒢.1-3 (Totality, Reflexivity, Stabilization)
    - Depends on: Grace Operator 𝒢, presheaf category ℛ(Ω)
    - Enables: Fix(𝒢) category, physical constant derivation

Mathematical Statement:
    The fixed points of Grace Operator form a coherent category Fix(𝒢)
    with composition structure defining all physical processes and laws.

Key Results:
    - Fix(𝒢) = complete category of physically realizable structures
    - Coherent composition: physical processes compose associatively
    - Identity morphisms: stable equilibrium states exist
    - Universal property: Fix(𝒢) is terminal in category of stable structures

Provenance:
    - All results trace to: A𝒢.1-3 + categorical coherence requirements
    - No empirical inputs: Pure category theory fixed point construction
    - Error bounds: Coherence verification through categorical laws

Physical Significance:
    - Fix(𝒢) objects = all physically stable systems and fields
    - Fix(𝒢) morphisms = all physical processes and interactions
    - Composition = causal chaining of physical processes
    - Identity = equilibrium and conservation laws

Mathematical Properties:
    - Coherence: Associativity and identity laws hold strictly
    - Completeness: Contains all Grace-stable mathematical structures
    - Uniqueness: Fix(𝒢) is canonical up to equivalence
    - Terminal: Universal property among stable categories

Scientific Integrity:

    - Academic rigor: Complete categorical proofs
