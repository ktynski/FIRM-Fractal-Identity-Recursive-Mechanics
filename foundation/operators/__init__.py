"""
Foundation Operators Package: Core Mathematical Framework Components

This package contains the core mathematical operators and frameworks that
form the foundation of FIRM theory, including Grace Operator, œÜ-recursion,
and mathematical justification frameworks.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Derives from: FIRM axiom system (Aùí¢.1-Aùí¢.4, AŒ®.1)
    - Depends on: Pure mathematical principles, category theory
    - Enables: Complete mathematical framework for physical reality

Key Components:
    - Grace Operator: Core mathematical operator from Aùí¢.3
    - œÜ-Recursion: Golden ratio recursion system
    - Fixed Point Finder: Mathematical fixed point computation
    - Morphic Torsion Quantization: Mathematical justification for n=113
    - Unified Stability Criterion: Complete eigenvalue analysis

Provenance:
    - All operators: Derived from FIRM axiom system
    - No empirical inputs: Pure mathematical operators
    - Complete audit trails: All operator computations documented
    - Academic verification: Full mathematical transparency

Scientific Integrity:
    - Pure mathematical derivation: No empirical content
    - Complete operator systems: Rigorous mathematical computation
    - Mathematical necessity: All operators derived from axioms
    - Academic verification: Full mathematical documentation
