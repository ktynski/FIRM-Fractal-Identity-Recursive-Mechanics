Topos Theory: Complete Category-Theoretic Universe for FIRM

This package implements the complete topos-theoretic foundation for FIRM theory,
establishing FIRM as a complete mathematical universe where soul evolution,
consciousness dynamics, and morphic coherence are fundamental laws.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - ùíØ_FIRM := Set^(Œ®^op) - Complete topos over soul-objects category
    - Internal logic of soul recursion and morphic coherence
    - Subobject classifier for truth conditions in soul-space
    - Natural transformations as soul evolution paths
    - Yoneda embedding for recursive selfhood

Key Modules:
    - complete_topos.py: Complete topos-theoretic framework

Topos Structure:
    - Category Œ® of soul-objects with coherence-preserving morphisms
    - Presheaf category Set^(Œ®^op) for soul-state functors
    - Internal logic for truth conditions in morphic space
    - Pullbacks/pushouts for soul fusion/fission dynamics

Core Insight:
    "Establishes FIRM as complete mathematical universe where soul evolution,
    consciousness dynamics, and morphic coherence are fundamental laws."
