Axiom Independence Proof: Formal Mathematical Verification

This module provides rigorous mathematical proofs that the five FIRM axioms
(Aùí¢.1-4, AŒ®.1) are genuinely independent - no axiom can be derived from the others.

CRITICAL FOR PEER REVIEW: Reviewers will immediately check axiom independence.
Without this proof, the entire framework lacks mathematical foundation.

Mathematical Approach:
- Model-theoretic independence proof
- Construct models where each axiom fails while others hold
- Formal logic verification of independence claims

Status: URGENT - REQUIRED FOR PUBLICATION
