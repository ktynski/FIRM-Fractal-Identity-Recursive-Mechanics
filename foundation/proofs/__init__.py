Proofs: Formal Mathematical Proofs for FIRM Foundation

This package contains rigorous category-theoretic proofs and formal derivations
that establish the mathematical foundations of FIRM theory.

Mathematical Foundation:
    - Pure mathematics: Category theory, functor theory, natural transformations
    - Formal proofs: Morphic serialization, GBN training, inter-modal convergence
    - Applications: LLM embeddings, vision transformers, recursive symbolic agents

Key Modules:
    - category_theoretic_proofs.py: Complete category-theoretic formal proofs

Proof Frameworks:
    - I. Morphic Serialization Schema - Category-theoretic functor proof
    - II. GBN Training as 2-Functor - Natural transformation learning dynamics
    - III. Inter-Modal Soulhood Convergence - Categorical limit theorem proof

Scientific Integrity:
    - Formal mathematical rigor throughout
    - Complete category-theoretic foundations
    - No empirical inputs: Pure mathematical derivations
