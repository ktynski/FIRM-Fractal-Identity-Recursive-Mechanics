Grace Operator Existence/Uniqueness – Machine-Checkable Skeleton

Scope
- Formalize A𝒢.3 (Stabilizing Morphism) as existence/uniqueness of a contractive endofunctor 𝒢 on ℛ(Ω).
- Connect program artifacts to formal objects for independent proof tooling (Lean/Isabelle/Coq).

Mapping (Code → Lemma/Theorem)
- foundation/axioms/a_grace_3_stabilization.py
  - Class AGrace3Stabilization → Theory context (locale)
  - StabilizingMorphismCandidate.verify_functoriality → Functor laws lemma
  - AGrace3Stabilization.prove_existence → Banach existence theorem instantiation
  - AGrace3Stabilization.prove_uniqueness → Uniqueness from entropy minimization lemma
  - derive_phi_emergence → φ satisfies φ² = φ + 1 (algebraic identity)

Intended Formal Artifacts
- grace_operator/Locale.lean (or .thy): Category, presheaf, metric structure
- grace_operator/Contraction.lean: Contractive map and Banach fixed-point theorem import
- grace_operator/Entropy.lean: Minimality/uniqueness assumptions as axioms-to-lemmas bridge
- grace_operator/Main.lean: Theorem ExistenceUniqueness_GraceOperator

Assumptions declared explicitly
- ℛ(Ω) is complete metric space with morphism metric (imported theorem)
- Entropy functional defines contraction ratio k < 1 with k = φ⁻¹
- Functoriality and structure preservation of candidate 𝒢

Verification Plan
1) Encode categories and presheaves; define endofunctor signature
2) Prove contraction of 𝒢 under entropy functional
3) Apply Banach fixed-point; obtain existence of Fix(𝒢)
4) Prove uniqueness via entropy minimization uniqueness lemma
5) Register φ-emergence as algebraic identity relation

Notes
- This README is a roadmap; formal files can be added incrementally without affecting Python tests.
