## Categories (ℛ(Ω) · Fix(𝒢))

### Purpose
Implement the presheaf category ℛ(Ω) with Yoneda embedding and the fixed point category Fix(𝒢) that models physically realizable structures.

### Integrity
- Fully mathematical; functoriality and representability checks are symbolic and unit-free.

### Status
- Minimal functoriality checks present; expanding to full naturality/isomorphism suites.
- Fix(𝒢) includes SM gauge fixed points and spacetime (3+1) eigenvalue structure.

For peer reviewers and readers

- Laws and obligations:
  - Presheaf category: identity, contravariant composition; Yoneda representables
  - Fixed point category: identity, associativity for morphism tokens; Grace-equivariance checks

- Tests and reproduction:
  - Presheaf functoriality:
    ```bash
    PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q testing/categories/test_presheaf_functoriality_teamd.py
    ```
  - Fixed point morphisms and compose errors:
    ```bash
    PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q testing/categories/test_fixed_point_morphism_equivariance_teamd.py
    ```

- Example (morphism tokens):
  - `compose((X→Y), (Y→Z)) → (X→Z)`; mismatched targets raise ValueError.

- Checklist:
  - No empirical inputs; symbolic structure only
  - Laws verified in tests (identity/associativity/functoriality)
  - Docstrings match actual semantics
