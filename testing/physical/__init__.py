Physical Tests Package: FIRM Physical Constant Validation

This package contains comprehensive tests for all FIRM physical constant
derivations and physical structure predictions.

Test Modules:
    - test_physical_constants: Fine structure, mass ratios, gauge couplings
    - test_spacetime_structure: Spacetime dimensionality and metric derivations
    - test_particle_spectrum: Complete Standard Model particle predictions
    - test_cosmological_parameters: Cosmic evolution parameter validation

Testing Framework:
    - Property-based testing using hypothesis
    - Statistical comparison with experimental data
    - Cross-validation between derivation methods
    - Performance benchmarking for computational efficiency

Scientific Rigor:
    - Complete experimental comparison through firewall
    - Statistical significance testing with proper uncertainty
    - Systematic bias detection and prevention
    - Academic transparency in all test methodologies
