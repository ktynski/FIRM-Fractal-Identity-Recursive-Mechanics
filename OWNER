# FIRM Project Integrity Ownership

## Integrity Responsibility
- **Primary Owner**: Development Team
- **Integrity Gate**: All PRs must pass contamination detection
- **Theory Branch**: `theory-only` branch frozen for pure mathematical work
- **Empirical Code**: Lives behind validation firewall only

## PR Gate Rules
1. **Contamination Scan**: Block on any quarantined key without proof
2. **Provenance Check**: All constants must have derivation provenance
3. **Test Coverage**: 100% test coverage for new mathematical derivations
4. **Documentation**: All changes must update relevant documentation

## Quarantine Enforcement
- CI blocks on quarantined usage without proof objects
- Automated scanning for forbidden numeric patterns
- Fail-closed provenance guard system
